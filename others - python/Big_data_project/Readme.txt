Additional -non mendatory project of big data :
- The .pdf are the instructions 
- The .csv can used in local or also be downloaded from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bl3f/amse2021/main/Homework/hebergements_classes.csv"
- Never been corrected, only graded (max point out of it)


This project, the questions and the idea are all the properties of Mr. BLEFARI (Christophe BLEFARI on Linkedin), my previous teacher of programmation for Data Science at the Aix - Marseille School of Economics.
